		Positioned like gemstones throughout the Kingdom's western and central valleys are five unique lodges, collectively referred to as Six Senses Bhutan. Each offers its own character, environment and experiences, yet together they can be crafted into one enchanting journey through the beauty, spirituality and culture of the Happiest Place on Earth.

You may visit a single lodge or, if you're curious about everything that Bhutan has to offer, we can plan a tailor-made journey that will include a combination of Thimphu, Punakha, Gangtey, Bumthang and Paro. The properties range in size and facilities, however our focus embraces the Six Senses guiding principles which include our pioneering spa and wellness offering, wholesome and sustainable cuisine, sleep health and self-discovery.</p>
